# CPS506 Review Session - Haskell and Rust Practice Questions

Welcome to the Haskell and Rust Practice Questions repository!

## Overview

This repository contains practice questions for Haskell and Rust programming languages. It's designed for self-study or as a resource for course review sessions.

## Structure

- **HaskellPractice**: Practice questions for Haskell.
  - **practice.hs**: Contains all the Haskell practice questions.

- **RustPractice**: Practice questions for Rust.
  - **main.rs**: Contains all the Rust practice questions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/PACS-TMU/cps506-review.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory for the language you want to practice:

    ```
    cd HaskellPractice  # or cd RustPractice
    ```

3. Open the `practice.hs` ot `main.rs` directory and start practicing!

## Running and Testing your Code
- Haskell
  - In the `/HaskellPractice` directory, run `ghci` and load the `practice.hs` file by running:
    ```
    :load practice.hs
    ```
  - After loading successfully, run each function with the test cases provided as comments. Make sure your output is as expected.
- Rust
  - In the `/RustPractice` directory, run:
    ```
    rustc main.rs
    ```
  - Once it compiles with no errors, run:
    ```
    ./main
    ```
  - This will print each function's test cases, along with your output vs the expected output.
